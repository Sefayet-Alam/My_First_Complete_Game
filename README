Gamejam Code for BUET 2023

In BUET Gamejam 2023, my team secured 16th position out of 70+ teams. It was quite hard for us to learn godot in just 3/4 days and make a game based on the theme. </br>

However, with sheer confidence and patience, we built a proper game with imaginations and insights </br>

Here are some photos of the game: </br>
